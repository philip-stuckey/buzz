Data Scientist and Developer

The Opportunity:  

As a data scientist, you’re excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set, and you’re fascinated by the possibilities presented by IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open new opportunities. As a data scientist at Booz Allen, you can help turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors—from fraud detection to cancer research to national intelligence—we need you to help find the answers in the data. 

On our team, you’ll use your analytical skills to help create real-world impact. You’ll work closely with clients to understand their questions and needs, and then dig into their data-rich environments to find the pieces of their information puzzle. You’ll work with and learn from your teammates as you develop algorithms and systems. You’ll use the right combination of tools and frameworks to turn sets of disparate data points into objective answers so that your clients can make informed decisions. Ultimately, you’ll provide a deep understanding of the data, what it all means, and how it can be used.  

Work with us as we use data science for good.
